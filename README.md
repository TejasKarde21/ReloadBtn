# ReloadBtn  :-  "https://tejaskarde21.github.io/ReloadBtn/day12reloadBtn/index.html"

In Javascript:-

 we get all the div circle square and button div.

 after that, I make an array of different colors. 

 Then to iterate on each and every color of the color array, I have to iterate on it for that
    I make a counter which will increase the counter as we click on the button it well increases the counter.
    and counter well increase up to its array length and after restarting it from 0 index I divide the counter + 1 to divide by array length.
    Because of there, it will  give us a zero.
  these were for changing the color of the circle.

  Now change the shape of a square inside the circle.
  For that, I get the shape button with an ID shape and give an event lister to it.
  first of all, I make a boolean value if is true .
  Then the condition will make the square into a triangle by using css property on it.
  Otherwise, again we click it and get false at its regain square propert which I give on else condition to form a square.

  This was all about the Project.
